                    <h2>POINT OF SALES SYSTEM</h2>
                    <p>POINT OF SALES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, is a system which is developed with the aim of eliminating manual record keeping in either large sized or medium sized businesses. It uses a simple camera to scan QR codes which is affordable to either small or medium sized businesses. By just scanning the QR codes, you will be able to know total amount of money you need to pay for the items you selected.</p>
